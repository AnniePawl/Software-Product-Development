# Software Construction 
Software construction is crucial because so much relies on it. Always strive to mprove software quality and productivity! 

### What Does Software Construction Entail?
- Problem definition 
- Requirements development 
- Construction planning 
- High-level design 
- Detailed design 
- Coding and Debugging 
- Unit testing 
- Integration testing 
- Corrective maintenance 

### Real World Examples 
- Determine how your code will be tested 
- Choose a convention to follow
- Design classes and routes 
- Create and name variables and constants 
- Select control structures 
- Unit test, debug your own code 
- Review teammate's code, vice versa
- Polish code, format and comment 
- Tune code, make it smaller and faster

# Major Construction Practices 
### Coding 
- How much design will be done upfront?
- Did you defind coding conventions for names, comments, layouts?
- Have you defined specific coding practices? Error handling, security, etc 
- Have you identified your location on Tech Wave and adjusted approach to match?
### Teamwork
- Solo programmin, pair programming? 
- Have you defined an integration procedure? When can code be committed to master?
### Quality Assurance 
- Are unit tests written first or last?
- Have you stepped thru code in debugger?
- Will teammates review eachother's code?
- Will programmers write test cases before writing code?
### Tools 
- Has a revision control tool been selected?
- Has a language or compiler version been selected? 
- Has a framework been selected?
- Will you allow non-standard language features?
- Have other helpful tools been identified?
