# Software Quality Landscape 

## Improving Software Quality 
- **External Audits** </br> 
</t>Audit team brought from outside to determine status of project or quality of product being developed.
- **Engineering Guidelines** </br>
Guidelines control tech character including problem def, requirements, architecture, construction, and testing
- **Informal Tech Reviews** </br>
Desk-check code by walking thru it with peers
- **Formal Tech Review**</br>
Catch problems at loest value stage. Quality gates!
- **Testing Strategy** </br>
Develop a testing strategy
- **Quality Assurance Activity** </br>
Very important. Dont perceive Q.A as a secondary goal!
