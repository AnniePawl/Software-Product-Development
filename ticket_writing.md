# Ticket Writing 

- Break tickets up into interative deliverables (MVP -> Final Product)
- Provide enough detail that any engineer can read it and understand whats needed and why feature is being built 
- Call out risks up front if they're know. Figure out how to ROAM them. 
- Bugs need detail as well: hwo to fix, expected behavior, etc..

## How to write a ticket 
- user story: concise statement about what you're building and why
- requirements: what are we building ?
- edge cases: what are known problems to keep in mind 
- risks: what are known risk, how will we address them
- business value: Why are we building this 

## Bug Tickets 
- Summary: 1-2 sentence description 
- Diagnostic info 
- Repro Steps
- Current Behavior 
- Expected Behavior

## ROAM Technique 
- Resolve: risk has been answered, avoided, or eliminated
- Own: Risk is owned by someone who is responsible for it and handling it 
- Accept: Risk accepted, nothing will be done about it  
- Mitigate: Lieklyhood and impact of risk has been decreased by certain actions
